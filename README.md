# MAL-Top-Anime--Stats
Scraped data of top anime on MyAnimeList (MAL) from page 1 to 270, which gave me  13,750 entries.

DRAFT VERSION:
The scraped data is placed into an pandas DataFrame, where the analysis is done.

The analis thus far:
* Check in which month the most top anime's were released
* Check in which year the most top animes were releases
* The mean star rating in each month

---------------
Still to be done:
* Use the MAL ref to gahter more detailed info on animes
* Details like:
  - Status
  - Genres ( Action, Award Winning, Sci-Fi, ens)
  - Premaire (Sprting, summer, winter, autum)
  - Studios
  - Themes (Adult Cast, Space)
  - Rating (PG13, R, R17+)
  
* The mean star rating in each year's releases
* Sub divide the year in months for better understanding
* Check which genre was most popular each year/month


--------------
Correlation Questions
* Is there a correlation between number episodes and rating given
